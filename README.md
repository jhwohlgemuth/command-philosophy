:anchor: Command Philosophy :anchor:
====================================
> I believe its impossible to fully characterize a person's command philosophy in a single document. An understanding of another's philosophy comes from extensive experience and interaction. Having a small number of easy-to-remember guiding principles is a useful tool to have toward attaining such an understanding. The command of a United States Navy Unit depends on the concept of ***sustainability***. That is, the Commanding Officer (or "Officer in Charge") must always consider who will replace him/her. With the future on the mind, the present becomes a chance to innovate, a time to learn, the basis for continued capability toward whatever mission or requirements assigned, and of course a time to perform.

> To make and maintain a sustainable unit, I have identified a core principles to use on a regular basis.

Adaptable
---------
The one constant in the world is *change*. Any solution that does not consider future issues is not even worth writing down. One must *adapt* to change, *manage* change, and *become better from it*. Adaptable also applies to new avenues of improvement. Maintaining a process because "we have always done it this way" is not a good enough reason. "Local" maximums are not enough and some times you need to take a step back so you can take two steps forward. In general, the most common manifestation of this principle is the **adoption of technology**. Concrete examples include configuring your email to filter and label emails, utilizing a chat app to communicate as a group, and writing your command philosophy on GitHub. Adapting to the "now" and preparing for the "future" leads to sustainability.

Consistent
----------
Treat subordinates *consistently* and apply standards *consistently*. This make it easier for others to approach and communicate with you, but it also allows for a greater understanding of what is "good" and "bad" in your interactions, communication, and processes. To use a math metaphor, an elementary student can solve `x + 3 = 5`, while `3x + 5y - z = 12` would prove difficult for most adults. *Consistency reduces variables* and allows for better solutions with less time and effort. Whether you are developing a relationship with the members of your unit or looking for a technical solution to a mission-related problem, taking a consistent approach will improve your chances of success. Consistent interactions and processes lead to sustainability.

Transparent
-----------
Transparent interaction can lead to trust and trust is essential to unit cohesion. I believe that trust comes from mutual respect and developed by consistent interactions over a period of time. To respect a person is to explicitly communicate his/her capabilities assessed under a consistently applied standard. Beyond involving every member of the team toward mission accomplishment, transparent interactions will help foster a positive command environment by setting clear goals with overt paths to accomplishment. More than an "open door policy", being transparent involves being **honest**, **overt**, and **inclusive**.
